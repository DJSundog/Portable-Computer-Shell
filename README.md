# Portable-Computer-Shell
A set of 3D printable enclosure designs for a DIY computer

This is a generic enclosure which is meant for hobbyist use. The side compartments support BL-5C type batteries and pathways are made to the center compartment which can hold the main electronics. The keyboard supports Cherry MX style keyswitches and Costar stabilizers. The cover/lid can support a monitor or other type of display or can be left as-is. The lid can be attached to the main body with off-the-shelf friction hinges.
